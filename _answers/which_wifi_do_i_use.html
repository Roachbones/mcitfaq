question: Which Wi-Fi network do I use?

<ul>
	<li>Most devices (laptops, desktops, and phones) should use <b>Marietta&nbsp;College</b>. When prompted to enter credentials, use your MyMarietta username and password.</li>
	<li>If you're in a residence hall and setting up a TV, Roku, Fire Stick, or similar device that doesn't move, connect it to <b>MC&nbsp;Streaming</b>.</li>
	<li><b>MC&nbsp;Guest</b> is for visitors without Marietta College credentials.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have difficulty joining a network, text a ticket to 740-530-4376 and we'll assist you.</p>
