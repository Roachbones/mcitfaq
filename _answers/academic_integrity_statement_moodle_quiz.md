## Academic Dishonesty

Dishonesty within the academic community is a very serious matter, because dishonesty destroys the basic trust necessary for a healthy educational environment. Academic  dishonesty is any treatment or representation of work as if one were fully responsible for it, when it is in fact the work of another person.

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, theft, or improper manipulation of laboratory or research data or theft of services. Plagiarism occurs when a writer deliberately uses someone else&#39;s language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without properly acknowledging its source (Marietta College Catalog, 2019-2020).

### THE PIONEER PLEDGE

The Marietta College Pioneer Pledge provides the philosophical foundation upon which the Code of Conduct, as described throughout this handbook, is based.

Honesty -  I will always communicate truthfully with all members of the Marietta College community.

Integrity -  I will always hold myself to the highest ethical principles both personally and academically.

Responsibility -  I will take responsibility for all of my decisions, and will challenge others to make decisions that put the community&#39;s best interest at the forefront, while holding them accountable  for the decisions that they make.

Respect - I will treat each individual on campus with respect and learn to appreciate the differences that make each individual and culture within our community unique.

Engagement-  I will be active within our community to make a positive difference, and to help serve those who are taking an initiative to better the lives of others.

I have read and understand the  **Academic Dishonesty Policy** of Marietta College as defined in the Undergraduate Catalog and I agree to abide by the Pioneer Pledge from the Student Handbook. As such, I commit to completing this exam with no outside assistance either by person or technology.
