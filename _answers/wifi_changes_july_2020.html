<h1>Wi-Fi Changes July 2020</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Removed MC Gaming from the whole campus.</b> This network is no longer available; any devices connected to it will need to be signed onto one of the new networks.</li><!--todo: link to "Which wifi should I use?-->
	<li><b>Added MC Streaming to residence halls.</b> This network is available only in Residence Halls and is intended for devices that don't move, such as TVs, Roku, Fire Sticks, etc.</li>
	<li><b>Marietta College is unchanged.</b> However, you may need to tell your computer to forget the network, and then connect to it again.</li>
	<li><b>MC Guest is unchanged</b> and still available across campus for visitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes eliminate the disconnect from Wi-Fi as you move between buildings and ensure you have consistent access to campus services while on Wi-Fi.  We are aware of certain classrooms with devices that were connected to MC Gaming and will be updating them.  If you have devices on campus that are connected to MC Gaming, then update them to use Marietta College.  If you have difficulty joining the Marietta College network, then text a ticket to 740-530-4376 and we'll assist you.</p>
