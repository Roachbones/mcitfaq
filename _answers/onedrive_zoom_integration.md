**Prerequisites**

- Zoom desktop client for Windows or Mac
- Microsoft OneDrive Integration enabled by the admin
- Microsoft account (personal, work, or school)
- **Note** : For the Zoom mobile app, you [can send files from OneDrive](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/202920879) using the built-in feature. An admin does not need to enable this feature on the mobile app.
