# Pin or Spotlight Video

## Overview

You can [**pin**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743) or [**spotlight**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362653) a video during a meeting.

Pin screen allows you to disable active speaker view and only view a specific speaker. Pinning another user&#39;s video will only affect your local view in the Zoom Room, not the view of other participants and will not affect cloud recordings.

Spotlight video puts a user as the primary active speaker for all participants in the meeting and cloud recordings. To spotlight, you need at least 3 participants in the meeting with their video on and can only be done by the host.
