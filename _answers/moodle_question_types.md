# Question Types in Moodle

Note: When appropriate, images, graphs, pictures, audio and video can be embedded in most question types (on the question itself or the answer area)

## Multiple choice
Allows the selection of a single or multiple responses from a pre-defined list of any length. Order of answers can be shuffled so beware of using "all of the above" (use "all of these" instead) or something like "Both a and b". Add complexity to your exam by allowing for more than one answer!

## True / False
A simple form of multiple-choice question with just the two choices 'True' and 'False'.

## Matching
The answer to each of several sub-questions must be selected from a list of possibilities presented in a dropdown list. You can provide extra incorrect answers by adding an answer to a blank question. Multiple questions can have the same answer if the answers are spelled exactly the same. This is a very good format to use as there are no reported issues with dropdown activities in Moodle.

## Short answer
Allows a response of one or a few words that is graded by comparing against various model answers, which may contain wildcards. These require manual grading!

## Numerical
Allows a numerical response, possibly with units, that is graded by comparing against various model answers, possibly with tolerances. These often require manual grading!

## Essay
Allows a response of a few sentences or paragraphs. Essay has a great feature called Response Template. With the response template it is possible to create a template to scaffold a student's answer in order to give them extra support and to help them organize their response for easier grading. The template is reproduced in a text editor where the student can input an answer. Essays require manual grading.

## Calculated
Calculated questions are like numerical questions, but with the numbers used selected randomly from a set when the quiz is taken.

## Calculated multichoice
Calculated multichoice questions are like multichoice questions which choice elements can include formula results from numeric values that are selected randomly from a set when the quiz is taken.

## Calculated simple
A simpler version of calculated questions which are like numerical questions but with the numbers used selected randomly from a set when the quiz is taken.

## Drag and drop into text
Missing words in the question text are filled in using drag and drop. These questions can be configured so that possible answers can be used more than once or have extra answers. Some devices such as certain tablets and PCs with touch screen capabilities may exhibit problems with Moodle's drag-and-drop features.

## Drag and drop markers
Markers are dragged and dropped onto a background image. Some devices such as certain tablets and PCs with touch screen capabilities may exhibit problems with Moodle's drag-and-drop features.

## Drag and drop onto image
Images or text labels are dragged and dropped into drop zones on a background image. Some devices such as certain tablets and PCs with touch screen capabilities may exhibit problems with Moodle's drag-and-drop features.

## Embedded answers (Cloze)
Questions of this type are very flexible, but can only be created by entering text containing special codes that create embedded multiple-choice, short answers and numerical questions.

## Random short - answer matching
Like a matching question but created randomly from the short answer questions in a particular category.

## Select missing words
Missing words in the question text are filled in using dropdown menus. This is a very good format to use as there are no reported issues with dropdown activities in Moodle.

## Description
This is not actually a question. Instead it is a way to add some instructions, rubric or other content to the quiz.
