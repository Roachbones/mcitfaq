# Proctoring by ProctorU Explained

- Each student proctored by ProctorU has their browser disabled.
- The system uses AI to watch the students eye movements, head movements, body language and typing patterns throughout the test.
- The proctor asks the students to pan the room and surroundings with their webcam before the exam to make sure there are no hidden resources available.
- Proctors will take control of a student&#39;s computer at the beginning of the session to input your exam password; this is to ensure students cannot possibly take an exam without a proctor. **Students never see the password and you should never share the password with your students.**
- If the student is allowed resources for the test, the proctor asks the student to show it to the camera.
- The student is required to keep their microphone on as the system &#39;listens&#39; for unusual and suspicious noises.
- All sessions are recorded. After the test is over, an individual watches the recording. All sessions are rereviewed. If a suspicious event occurs you will be sent an incident report.
- ProctorU will never stop an exam session even if it appears the student is cheating. You will be sent a complete incident report with a recommendation from ProctorU on how severe they deem the breach to be. It is the faculty member&#39;s responsibility to bring the student up on academic dishonesty charges if a breach occurs. ProctorU will provide you with video evidence and an incident report to back you up.
- ProctorU CANNOT proctor Chromebooks or tablets. These students must be proctored in Zoom by either you or one of our proctoring staff.
- Faculty should read the student FAQs provided and email it to their students and/or post it in Moodle.
- If the faculty member would like extra signage placed in their Moodle area about proctoring, please ask. We are happy to add it.
- Students should be encouraged to show up for their ProctorU appointments 30 minutes in advance and should verify their equipment is working properly for testing ahead of time. Students see the link to do this several times in the sign-up process.
- The Facilitator Dashboard provides you with a detailed understanding of your test-takers&#39; proctored sessions.
