- Increase the volume on your mobile device using the volume buttons or notification panel. Even if the speaker is turned on in Zoom, your device's volume might be set to mute or vibrate only.
- Try using earphones.
- Restart your mobile device.
- Reinstall Zoom from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings&amp;hl=en_US)

## Troubleshooting Microphone Issues

If you are experiencing issues using your microphone with the Zoom mobile app, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Ensure the microphone is not on mute. If you see the muted  **Audio**  icon in the meeting controls, tap it to unmute yourself:

 If you are still muted, the host may have muted you upon entering the meeting. Ask to be unmuted by sending a [chat message](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203650445-In-Meeting-Chat) to the host.
- Ensure you have connected your mobile device's audio. If you see the following  **Audio**  icon in the meeting controls, tap it and select  **Call via Device Audio**. If prompted, allow Zoom to access your microphone.
