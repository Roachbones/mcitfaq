# Zoom Safety

- Never post your Zoom meeting links or recording links on social media. Be careful how you share them. 
- Because of FERPA regulations, never share a class recording link outside of the registered students in your class. Use Marietta College email or Moodle (preferred) to share that recording link. 
- In order to respect the business of Marietta College and other participants, protect committee/office meeting recordings as well. If you must share a recording link for a Marietta College business/committee meeting, do so in Marietta College email or SharePoint. 
- If you feel your Zoom meet link has been compromised or is not as secure as it can be, delete it and create a new room. Please note that this will change your meeting link details so you will have to send it out again to those who need it. 
- Password protect AND use a waiting room if needed. 
- Change the password on a regular basis.
